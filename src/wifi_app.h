 * @details This header file defines the interface for WiFi management
 *          functionality used in the ESP32 weather station project. It provides
 *          configuration constants, data structures, function prototypes, and
 *          message types for handling dual-mode WiFi operation with Access
 *          Point configuration and Station connectivity management including
 *          network discovery and automatic reconnection capabilities.
